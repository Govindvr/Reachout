## Reachout ##

Most of the students face problems getting started with a tech stack or any other skill. The main reason for this is the lack of proper guidance or not knowing where to start, along with the students' hesitation to reach out for help.

To deal with the mentioned problem, we introduce **Reachout**, an online platform to enable beginners to get mentors. This platform allows students to search for the stack or skills they like to learn, clear doubts on topics from various fields, and provide them with a list of expert people on the same. Furthermore, Reachout helps the students to get better recommendations and content library to start with their career and go in the flow. 

Students can register on this site, giving details about areas they are confident in, their interests, and showcase projects and works they have done. When a student searches for their requirements, the search results displayed will be filtered accordingly providing only the best in that field.
